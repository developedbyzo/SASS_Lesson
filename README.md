## Explanations of Technologies Used
SASS, CLI & HTML. 
Link CSS into HTML Boilerplate.
Bootup compiler for SASS to input and output into CSS to export files
CLI:  ``sass --watch style.sass:app.css'


## Approach Taken
We searched online for the main source of the page but found a lot of information convoluted or using technologies with SASS we haven't approached yet.

## Learning
SASS is a CSS preprocessor that takes code and compiles it into different code.
 
Interesting note is that there are two preprocessors within SASS. One is SASS (.sass) and the other SCSS (.scss). We used SASS in our project and that has been a challenge since its syntax does away with CSS syntax while SCSS uses all the familiar syntax  of colons and brackets. This makes SCSS easier to use in existing projects. 

Note: It's also important to have a decent understanding of CSS before approaching SASS.

## Further Comments

## Why did you choose this subject?
Because we are interested in front-end development and SASS in our research is considered a known must have skill.

## How were you first made aware of it?
See answer above.

## What problem does it solve?
It simplifies lengthy CSS code making it faster and cleaner when organizing and running your app.

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
When you have to change a color/font/var/etc. multiple times while going through a long stylesheet, SASS makes your set up simple.

## What are the alternatives?
SCSS as another preprocessor option.

What is the history of this technology?
Who built it and why?
Who is maintaining it?
## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
It's a lot of work for us still since the set up is different.

## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
The information on SASS is vast but inconsistent in explanations and the use of technologies we haven't used is also an issue.

## What resources do you recommend for interested students?
